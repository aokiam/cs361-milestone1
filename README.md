This is the main repo for my CS361 project.
It's a music recommendation station for kpop and jpop, it matches attributes of different
kpop and jpop artists and recommends you what you're looking for based on your taste 
in music. Currently, you can enter a jpop artist and get a recommended kpop artist,
enter a kpop artist and get a recommended jpop artist, and compare two aritsts.

Later to be implemented:
   information page of all artists
   page where you can look through all the artists in the program
   randomize option when looking for kpop or jpop recommendations
