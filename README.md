This is the main repo for my CS361 project.<br>
It's a music recommendation station for k-pop and j-pop, it matches attributes of different<br>
k-pop and j-pop artists and recommends you what you're looking for based on your taste<br>
in music. You can enter a j-pop artist and get a recommended k-pop artist, enter a k-pop<br>
artist and get a recommended j-pop artist, get a randomized recommendation for either a <br>
k-pop or j-pop artistm compare two aritsts, and look up information on an artist.<br>
